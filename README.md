# Magnara

Machine learning project where we explore the application of reinforcement learning using the 
[Gym](https://gym.openai.com/) toolkit

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for testing purposes.


## Prerequisites

In order to successfully compile and run the code, [Python 3.x](https://www.python.org), [Gym](https://gym.openai.com/) and 
[box2d-py](https://pypi.org/project/box2d-py/) should be installed. 


## Installing dependencies

### Windows

[TODO]: # (TODO: See if this is even possible without Visual Studio)

**Instructions for how to successfully set up a working environment in Windows will be provided if there's a feasible 
solution outside of Visual Studio and Visual Studio Build Tools.  
It is highly recommended to install this on Linux or macOS**


### Linux

```bash
apt-get install build-essential
apt-get install python3
apt-get install python3-pip 

pip3 install gym
pip3 install box2d-py
```
